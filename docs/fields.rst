Fields
======

The following fields of snippets have a value automatically generated for them
and hence clients are not supposed to explicitly provide them:

    - :confval:`id`
    - :confval:`created`
    - :confval:`updated`
    - :confval:`owner`

The rest of the fields are optional, except for :confval:`content`.
